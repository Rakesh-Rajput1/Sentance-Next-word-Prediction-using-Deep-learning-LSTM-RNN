# Next Word Prediction Using LSTM RNN

This project demonstrates how to build a **Next Word Prediction** model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers in Python with Keras and TensorFlow.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to predict the next word in a sentence based on the input sequence of words. This is a common NLP task and forms the basis for features like autocomplete and smart text suggestions.

We use LSTM layers because they are well-suited for sequence data and can capture long-term dependencies better than vanilla RNNs.
